               In other cases, viral enzymes can also process these pre-mRNAs. During transcriptional elongation, a certain length of precursor RNA is being made, and its three prime end contains two essential signal sequences for polyadenylation. The signal sequences include an AAUAAA poly-A addition site sequence and a GU-rich sequence located at downstream. These signals will recruit specific enzymes to cleave between these two sequences, and create a novel OH 3â€™ end 10-35 nucleotides downstream from the AAUAAA sequence. This cleavage is also required for transcriptional termination. Cleaved GU-rich sequence is then degraded. This newly made free OH end provides a poly-A addition site for the poly-A polymerase.
